Day and night
Make my way through mountains
I hear voices
But they are my own
As I look
I see other things surround me
So it looks like
Escaping ain't easy
It's quiet now
The hour's getting late
I'm all gone
The creeper saw me fly away
It may be luck or it
Might be down to sheer will
That I obtained this
amazing new skill
This is not
What it is supposed to be
Cause when I run
I will step back slightly
There's nothing here
Which is worth fighting for
We were rich
Before we had diamonds
Whenever I go back in time
I see places that I never saw
Things I failed to notice
But I can see them now
