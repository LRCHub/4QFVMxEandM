```lrc
[01:07.57] Day and night
[01:09.64] Make my way through mountains
[01:11.87] I hear voices
[01:14.27] But they are my own
[01:16.28] As I look
[01:17.43] I see other things surround me
[01:20.23] So it looks like
[01:22.28] Escaping ain't easy
[01:31.78] 
[01:41.56] It's quiet now
[01:43.42] The hour's getting late
[01:45.97] I'm all gone
[01:47.32] The creeper saw me fly away
[01:50.06] It may be luck or it
[01:51.80] Might be down to sheer will
[01:53.87] That I obtained this amazing new skill
[02:12.87] 
[02:32.33] This is not
[02:33.86] What it is supposed to be
[02:36.36] Cause when I run
[02:37.71] I will, step back slightly
[02:40.59] There's nothing here
[02:42.23] Which is worth fighting for
[02:44.62] We were rich
[02:46.47] Before we had diamonds
[02:57.47] 
[03:05.72] Whenever I go back in time
[03:10.13] I see places that I never saw
[03:14.44] Things I failed to notice
[03:19.03] But I can see them now
